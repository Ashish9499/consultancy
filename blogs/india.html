							<h1>How to Scale Your Consulting Business to $1M (And Beyond)</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic14.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>The firm model is your classic consulting firm. You hire consultants to deliver projects, usually billing by the hour or by the day. As the firm owner, you take a margin of the profit.The firm model is a highly scalable consulting business model that’s favorable to growth.When you’re running a consulting firm, you aren’t always going to be working closely with clients on consulting projects. You can, but that’s only one part of it.</p>
							<p> I have an office manager who takes care of all of my invoicing and billing and also sets up the initial interviews if they need additional resources. We’ve got another person that helps manage the staffing organization. I’ve got the usual accountant, attorney, financial adviser, and a banker who helps with loans because a lot of these companies don’t pay for 90 days, so we have to deal with that. </p>
                            <p>hen as far as people on the ground, I’ve got about a dozen people on the ground at different clients who are doing mostly project management work, but there’s a number of designers, product people, and a finance person. I got three finance people in one of our clients.</p>

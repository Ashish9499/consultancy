							<h1>Consultant’s Guide to Productization</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic16.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                             <p> Most consulting services involve you working closely with a buyer, creating a custom solution or solving a problem.Instead of creating a unique solution for each buyer, you create the same solution applicable to all of your buyers.Without focus in your process, your client profile, and the problem you’re solving, your productized offer itself, will turn into an unprofitable complicated mess.</p>                           
					         <p>Productized consulting straddles the middle between a “Product” and a “Service,” borrowing elements of both.That said, you are able to market your solution as unique to each buyer in sales conversations because unlike a product, you are working with the client. You’re just using the same process for each client.</p>
							 <p>Of course, you can’t escape the risk of your clients asking you for more customization with the productized service you’re offering.The more you break away from your proven process and system, the more complex your delivery will become — until, drip by drip, all of the benefits of your productized offer are gone.</p>

							<h1>Our 10 Guiding Principles: Inside Our Consulting Business And Life</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p> I’ll speak for myself but less is more is really the way we look at what we do in life and what we do in our business. What we mean by that is that instead of focusing on everything and focusing on anything that’s out there, really focus on the few things that matter. Focus on the few things that are important. Focus on the few things that give us the most enjoyment or really give back the most. </p>
							<p> Those are really great points. What I would also share is that what we’re going to be taking you through and opening up in terms of our observations to you, these are based on a lot of trial and error, a lot of learning experiences or what people call failures. Sam and I have been together for almost eighteen, nineteen years now in terms of building businesses together.</p>
							<p>Our third guiding principle is excellence. This is one that I believe every entrepreneur who is opt to great things or has the ambition to achieve great things is focused on. In most cases I believe it’s a conscious decision. Maybe sometimes you’re busy doing what you’re doing that it becomes a bit subconscious. It’s becomes like a habit. I know that for Sam and I and in our businesses over the years, we’ve always wanted to get better. We’ve never felt we’ve reached a place where we’re satisfied. We want to be grateful and appreciate our accomplishments, what we’ve done, and we want to look backwards and be grateful for that.</p>

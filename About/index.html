                <span><!-- line here --></span>

                <p>I am an Empathic and Cheerful person, practicing Counseling and Psychotherapy since 2008.
                    I hold a Masters degree in Psychology. I am a certified CBT, REBT, Emotional Intelligence techniques and Sleep Counseling practitioner.</p>
                <p>My counseling approach is Humanistic, Considerate, Affable and Trustworthy. In the interactive process of counseling,
                    I follow a combination of variety of latest psychotherapies and strength-based approaches to help the clients achieve their personal
                     as well as professional goals. I practice face to face customized counseling and a therapy designed as per the clientâ€™s requirements.</p>
               <p> I believe and practice in empowering individuals identify and understand patterns of their behavior and blind 
                spots that keep them trapped in vicious cycles. In the process of providing counseling, knowledge, vision and healing to clients,
                 I am with them throughout their journey of healing.</p>
